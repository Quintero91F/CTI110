# This program collects user input scores, validates them, removes the lowest score, calculates the average of the remaining scores, and displays the corresponding letter grade.

# Start

# Prompt the user to enter how many scores they wish to input.

# Initialize an empty list to store the valid scores.

# Use a loop to collect the user's scores:

# After collecting all the scores:
 
# Display:
    
# End
