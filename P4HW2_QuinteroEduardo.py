# A brief description: This program calculates the pay for multiple employees,  including overtime and regular pay, and computes total amounts for each category.


# 1. Initialize variables for total overtime, total regular pay, total gross pay, and employee count.
# 2. Prompt the user for the employee's name.
# 3. If the name is "Done", break out of the loop.
# 4. Otherwise, ask for the employee's hourly pay rate and hours worked.
# 5. Calculate regular pay and overtime pay based on hours worked.
# 6. Update the total overtime, total regular pay, total gross pay, and employee count.
# 7. Display employee's hours worked, pay rate, overtime pay, regular pay, and gross pay after each entry.
# 8. Repeat until the user enters "Done".
# 9. Output the total overtime, regular pay, gross pay, and the number of employees processed.

# Step 1: Initialize totals and employee count
total_overtime = 0
total_regular = 0
total_gross = 0
employee_count = 0

# Step 2: Ask for the first employee's details
while True:
    # Ask for employee name
    employee_name = input("Enter employee's name or 'Done' to terminate: ")
    
    # If user enters "Done", exit the loop
    if employee_name.lower() == "done":
        break
    
    # Step 3: Get pay rate and hours worked
    try:
        hours_worked = float(input(f"How many hours did {employee_name} work? "))
        pay_rate = float(input(f"What is {employee_name}'s pay rate? "))
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter valid numbers for pay rate and hours worked.")
        continue
    
    # Step 4: Calculate regular and overtime pay
    if hours_worked > 40:
        regular_pay = 40 * pay_rate  # Regular pay is for first 40 hours
        overtime_hours = hours_worked - 40  # Overtime hours
        overtime_pay = overtime_hours * (pay_rate * 1.5)  # Overtime pay is 1.5 times the hourly rate

    print("-" * 70)
    
    # Step 8: Display employee details with aligned columns and dollar signs
    print(f"{hours_worked:<15.2f}{pay_rate:<10.2f}{overtime_hours:<10.2f}"
          f"${overtime_pay:>12,.2f}     ${regular_pay:>10,.2f}     ${gross_pay:>10,.2f}")
